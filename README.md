# Insaight-Magazine-Website
Started as a fun project to build a website for my department "Insaight" in my college.
Insaight is the magazine making and publishing department of our campus.
We publish sketches, poems, essays, articles, invitations, notices, flyers, covershots, photos of ongoing events and much more
which are contributed to us by our dear student brothers and the campus faculty.

I have used html, css and javascript to build the website.
Also thank you everyone for providing me wonderful ideas that I could implement in the website.

[Tried to host it via campus cloud storage (SAN) and via system's IP address connected to other systems over LAN]

Thank you.

Have a nice day.
